# Hyprland Configuration - Matrix Green Theme

## ── General Settings ─────────────────────────
# Set user-defined $mods for convenience (optional)
$mainMod = SUPER

# No window rounding, neon green borders
decoration {
    rounding = 0                # sharp corners, no rounding
    blur = false                # disable blur if any
    drop_shadow = false         # no shadows for a crisp look
    border_size = 2             # 2px border width for windows
}

# Color scheme: use solid greens for active/inactive borders
# (Format 0xAARRGGBB – here AA=ff for full opacity)
col.active_border   = 0xff27f546  # bright green for active window border
col.inactive_border = 0xff009417  # darker green for inactive windows

## ── Animations (disabled for performance) ──
animations {
    enabled = false            # turn off animations for speed and lower resource usage
}

# Gaps between windows (for tiling)
gaps_in  = 4    # small gap between windows (helps separate double borders)
gaps_out = 0    # no outer gap (windows touch screen edges, bar will reserve space)

# Set wallpaper to black (solid color)
exec-once = swaybg -c "#000000"   # requires swaybg installed; fills background with black

## ── Keybindings ─────────────────────────────
# Format: bind = MOD, key, action, argument
# Window management
bind = SUPER, Q, killactive      # Super+Q closes the focused window
bind = SUPER, C, togglefloating  # Super+C toggles floating (detach/attach)
bind = SUPER, V, togglefloating
bind = SUPER, V, centerwindow, 1 # Super+V: float (if not already) and center window on screen

bind = SUPER, F, exec, dolphin    # Super+F launches Dolphin file manager
bind = SUPER, B, exec, firefox    # Super+B launches Firefox browser
bind = SUPER, Enter, exec, alacritty  # Super+Enter opens Alacritty terminal
bind = SUPER, Space, exec, wofi --show drun   # Super+Space opens Wofi launcher (drun mode)

# Window focus navigation (arrow keys to move focus)
bind = SUPER, Left,  movefocus, l
bind = SUPER, Down,  movefocus, d
bind = SUPER, Up,    movefocus, u
bind = SUPER, Right, movefocus, r

# Move window to different workspace (Super+Ctrl+←/→)
bind = SUPER_CTRL, Left,  movetoworkspacesilent, m-1   # send to previous workspace on this monitor
bind = SUPER_CTRL, Right, movetoworkspacesilent, m+1  # send to next workspace on this monitor

# Workspace switching (Super+Number row) – optional, 1-9 keys to switch to workspace
bind = SUPER, 1, workspace, 1
bind = SUPER, 2, workspace, 2
bind = SUPER, 3, workspace, 3
# ... (repeat for more workspaces if needed)

## ── Window Rules ────────────────────────────
# Float and center the Wofi launcher when it appears, so it’s not tiled
windowrule = float, class:Wofi              # make wofi windows floating
windowrule = center 1, class:Wofi           # center wofi on screen (respect reserved bar area)

# Force certain apps to start in dark mode if possible (Dolphin picks up Qt theme)
# e.g., for Electron apps or GTK apps one might set environment variables (not needed for Dolphin)

## ── Autostart (exec-once) ───────────────────
exec-once = waybar &          # start Waybar (status bar)
exec-once = alacritty &       # launch a terminal at startup (so user has a shell open)

#######################################
#  helpers & tray items (Matrix-style)
#######################################
exec-once = /usr/lib/polkit-gnome/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1 &
exec-once = nm-applet --indicator &
exec-once = blueman-applet &
exec-once = udiskie &

# NOTE: Ensure Waybar and Wofi are installed. Wofi does not run as daemon; it's launched via keybind.
# The above commands with '&' run them in background so Hyprland can continue startup.
